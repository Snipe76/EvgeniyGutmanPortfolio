## 📁 The Secret Organization Files

My code is organized with the precision of a library run by cats—surprisingly effective!

### Folder Structure
```
project-name/
├── images/                # Picture paradise
│   └── screenshot.png     # Photographic evidence of my genius
├── css/                   # Style sanctuary
├── js/                    # JavaScript jungle (for JS projects)
├── index.html             # The main attraction
├── transition.html        # The magical portal between pages
└── README.md              # You are here! 👋
```

### Documentation
Every project comes with its own mini-novel explaining:
  - What it is (besides awesome)
  - How it works (magic, mostly)
  - Why you should be impressed (multiple reasons)
  - How to use it (even if you still use Internet Explorer)
