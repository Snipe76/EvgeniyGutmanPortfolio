## 🚀 Legendary Features

- **👥 Choose Your Battle**: Fight a friend in PvP or challenge our AI overlord in PvC mode

  - 🔴 **Hard Mode**: The AI has downloaded the entire internet and will crush your soul. Good luck, human!
- **📱 Battlefield Adaptability**: Fight on any screen size, from tiny phones to cinema displays

- **👆 Finger-Friendly Interface**: No tiny buttons that require microscopic precision
- **🎨 Aesthetically Pleasing**: Because even simple games deserve beautiful design

## 🧠 Behind the Code Curtain

Our game's code is cleaner than a surgeon's operating room:

1. **📝 No Magic Numbers Here!**
   - All numbers have proper names and live in `config.js`
   - "3" isn't just a number, it's `BOARD_SIZE` (very fancy)

2. **🧩 Code Organization Perfection**
   - Each function does exactly one thing (and it does it well!)
   - Our functions are like tiny specialized workers who never get confused about their job

3. **📂 File Structure That Makes Marie Kondo Proud**
   - Everything has a place, and everything is in its place
   - Open any file and instantly know what it does (magic!)

4. **💬 Comments That Actually Help**
   - We don't comment obvious things like `// increment counter`
   - We do explain complex algorithms and "why" decisions
   - Our comments occasionally contain dad jokes (sorry not sorry)

5. **♻️ DRY Code (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - We're environmentally conscious and recycle code
   - Copy-paste is a sin in our religion

## ⚙️ The Game Engine (AKA The Ministry of Game Rules)

Our game engine (`GameEngine.js`) is the wise old wizard that:
- 🎲 Remembers whose turn it is (because players often forget)
- ✅ Makes sure you don't cheat by clicking occupied cells
- 🏆 Knows when someone wins (or when cats game happens)
- 🔄 Lets you switch between "destroy friendship" and "destroy AI" modes

## 🧠 The AI Player (AKA Your Digital Nemesis)

The AI player (`AIPlayer.js`) contains:
- 🧮 Minimax algorithm that can see the future (spooky!)
- 🎚️ Difficulty settings from "barely functioning" to "skynet"
- 🎯 Perfect play on hard mode that will make you question your life choices
- ⚡ Optimized first moves because waiting is boring

## 🖥️ The UI (AKA The Pretty Part)

The UI controller (`UIController.js`) makes everything look good:
- 🖱️ Handles clicks, taps, and probably telepathy (coming soon)
- 🎭 Updates the board without mysterious flashes or glitches
- ✨ Adds those fancy animations that make you go "oooooh"
- 📱 Works on all devices because we're not monsters
